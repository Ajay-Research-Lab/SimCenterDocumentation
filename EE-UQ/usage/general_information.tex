The user here provides information about the building and the units
the user will work in. The widget itself contains 4 separate frames,
as shown in \Cref{fig:figure2}:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Building Information frame in which user provides general information about the building, including year of construction and type.
\item Properties frame in which user provides information about number of stories, width, depth, plan area and height of the building.
\item Location frame in which user provides location of the building. This information is used in some event widgets to obtain events specific to the building location.
\item Units frame in which user specifies what the units will be for the inputs and outputs. Some widgets will require inputs in different units. These entries will contain units beside the specific entry to mark this.
\end{enumerate}
