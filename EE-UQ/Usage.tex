\section{User Interface}

It is the user interface (UI) that the user interacts with. The interface itself, as
shown in \autoref{fig:figure1}, is broken down into a number of separate areas:


\begin{figure}[!htbp]
  \centering {
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]
    {figs/Figure1.png} }
  \caption{UI}
  \label{fig:figure1}
\end{figure}


\begin{enumerate}

\item Input Panel Selection: This  area on the left side provides the user with a selection of items to choose from from: 

\begin{enumerate}
  \item GI: General information, for specifiction of building description, location and units.
  \item SIM: Structure information model, for description of the building model.
  \item EVT: Event, for selecting the earthquake motions input.
  \item FEM: Finite element method, for specification of application and analysis options.
  \item UQ: Uncertainty quantification, for defining the distribution of the random
  variable paramaters and UQ method analysis options.
  \item EDP: Engineering demand parameters, for specification of output response quantities.
  \item RES: Results output.
\end{enumerate}

Selecting any of these will change the input panel presented.

\item Input Panel: This is the large central area of the UI that the user provides input
for the application chosen and views the results. For example if the user had selected UQ in the input panel selection, it is in this panel that the user would provide details on the distributions associated with each random variable or select the sampling method to use and provide the options necessary to run that method.

\item Push Buttons: This is the area near the bottom of the UI in which 4 buttons are presented to the user:

\begin{enumerate}
\item	RUN – to run the simulation of the user’s desktop machine.
\item	RUN at DesignSafe – to process the information, and send to DesignSafe where the job will be run on a supercomputer and results stored in your DesignSafe jobs folder.
\item	GET from DesignSafe – to obtain from DesignSafe your list of jobs and select from that list a job to download.
\item	Exit: to exit the application.
\end{enumerate}

The Screens presented to user when the first 3 of these buttons will be discussed in section 3.10.

\item Login Button: At the top right of the UI is the login button. Before the user can launch any jobs on DesignSafe they must first login to DesignSafe using their DesignSafe login and password. Pressing the login button will open up the login window for users to enter this information.

\item Message Area: In the top center of the application is the area of the interface that error and status messaged will be displayed while the application is running.

\end{enumerate}

\section{GI: General Information}
The user here provides information about the building and the units the user will work in. The widget itself presents 3 separate frames, as shown in \autoref{fig:figure2}, to the user:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Building Information frame in which user provide general information about the building, this include year of construction and type.
\item Properties frame in which user provides information about number of stories, width, depth, plan area and height of the building.
\item Location frame in which user provides location of the building. This information is used in some of event widgets to obtain events specific to the building.
\item Units frame  in which user specifies what the units will be for the inputs and outputs. Some widgets will require inputs in different units. These entries will contain units beside the specific entry to mark this.
\end{enumerate}


\begin{figure}[!htbp]
  \centering {
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]
    {figs/Figure2.png} }
  \caption{BIM}
  \label{fig:figure2}
\end{figure}

\section{SIM: Structural Information Model}

This panel is where the user defines the structural model of the building. The structural model is that part of the building provided to resist the lateral loads. There are a number of backend applications provided for this part of the workflow, each responsible for providing the structural analysis model to the workflow. The drop-down menu at the top of this panel is where the user selects which application to use. As the user switches between applications, the entry data changes to reflect the different inputs the different applications require. At present there are two backend applications available through the drop down menu: MDOF and OpenSees.

\subsection{MDOF}

This panel is provided for users to quickly create simple shear models of a building. The panel is divided into 3 frames:
\begin{enumerate}
\item in the top left frame the user enters the number of stories. For each story the user then enter the story height, initial stifness in 1 and 2 directions, yield strength in 1 and 2 directions, and hardeing ratio again in 1 and 2 directions. In addition user enters the floor weights and damping ratios for each of the modes.
\item In the lower left frame the user has the option of overriding an an individual floor or story basis, any of the properties set in the upper frame.
\item on the right side of the frame is a graphical widget showing the current building. When entering data into the lower left frame, those floors and stories corresponding to data being modified is highlighted in red.
\end{enumerate} 

Random Variables: Random Variables can be created by the user entering a valid string instead of a number in the entry fields for all entries except the number of floors. The variable name entered will appear as a Random Variable in the UQ panel and it is there that the user must enter the distribution for the Random Variable.


\subsection{OpenSees}
The panel is for users who have existing OpenSees model of a building that performs a gravity analysis and now wish to subject that building model to one of the EVENT options provided. The panel that presents is as shown in \autoref{fig:figure3}. The user has 3 fields that he needs to fill out:
\begin{enumerate} 
\item The user specifies the main script that contains the building model. This script should build a model and perform any gravity analysis of the building that is required before the event is applied.
\item A llist of nodes that define a column line of interest for which the responses will be determined. The column nodes should be in order from ground floor through to roof. The EDP options use this information to determine nodes at which displacement, acceleration and story drifts are calculated. 
\item An entry for the dimension of the model, i.e. 1D, 2D or 3D. This information is used to apply ground motions.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{figure}[!htbp]
  \centering {
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]
    {figs/Figure3.png} }
  \caption{OpenSees Input Model}
  \label{fig:figure3}
\end{figure}

Random Variables: In OpenSees there is an option to set variables to have certain values using the pset command, e.g pset a 5.0 will set the variable a to have a value 5 in an OpenSees script. In EE-UQ any variable found in the main script to be set using the pset command will be assumed to be a Random Variable. As such, when a new main script is loaded all variables set with pset will appear as Random Variables in the UQ panel.


\section{EVT: Event}
The event panel presents the user with a drop-down menu with a list of available event applications. Event applications are applications that, given the building and user supplied data to the specific
applications input panel, will generate a list of events for the building. There are a number of options available in the pull-down menu.

\input{EarthquakeEvents}


\section{FEM: Finite Element Method}
The FEM panel is intended to present users with a selection of FEM applications that will take a building model generated by the BIM application and the EVENT from the event application and perform a deterministic simulation. 
At present there is only one application available, OpenSees and there is no application selection box.  That will be modified in future versionsto allow user to provide their own simulation application.  This is not the standard OpenSees executable, but consists of a pre- and post-processor to take the  BIM and EVENT file and use OpenSees to determine the response, returning these responses in an EDP. 

For the OpenSees application the user is required to specify the options to be used in the transient analysis. As shown in the figure this includes the choice of 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Solution algorithm, the default is Newton Raphson.
\item Integration Scheme, the default is Newmarks linear acceleration method.
\item Convergence Test, the default is a norm on the unbalance force.
\item Convergence tolerance
\item Damping Ratio.
\end{enumerate}

All the options available can be found in the OpenSees online user manual.\\

A default transient analysis script is run with these inputs. It is built for Version 3.0.0+ of OpenSees and uses a divide and conquer  algorithm in event of a convergence failure issue. This new algorithm does not always work. \\

The user is also able to specify their 
own analysis script to run instead of the default. When chosen the variables numStep and dt that are obtained from the EVENT are set by the program. These variables can be used by the user when providing their own analysis script.

\section{UQ}
Throughout the input specification the user is defining variables. As described in the above sections many of these variables can be specified by the user to be random variables with a distribution on their values. It is in the UQ panel that the user specifies what these distributions are. 
It is also here that the user specifies the UQ method and the input values are for these UQ methods. 
The panel is split,  as shown in \autoref{fig:figure10}, into 2 frames:
 \begin{enumerate}
\item Sampling Methods 
\item Random Variables
\end{enumerate}

\begin{figure}[!htbp]
  \centering {
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]
    {figs/Figure10.png} }
  \caption{UQ}
  \label{fig:figure10}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Sampling Methods}
In the sampling methods the user selects the sampling method to use from the method dropdown. Currently this is limited to two options: 
Monte Carlo and Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS). For the one selected, the user specifies the number of simulations to be perform and the seed.

\subsection{Random Variables}
The Random Variable panel is where the user enters the random variables. Each random variable has a name and a distribution. The distribution is selected frm the drop-down menu. By changing the distribution type, the inputs required to define the distribution change. The following are the list of distributions available:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Normal
\item Lognormal
\item Beta
\item Uniform
\item Weibull
|item Gumbell
\item UserDef
\end{enumerate} 

As with other panels, the random variables can be added or removed. Care must be taken by the user in ensuring that if the user removes random variables from this panel that they also remove them from the other input widgets. Failing to do so may result in the program faling to complete.


\begin{figure}[!htbp]
  \centering {
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]
    {figs/Figure11.png} }
  \caption{Random variables}
  \label{fig:figure11}
\end{figure}

\section{EDP: Engineering Demand Parameters}
This panel is where the user selects the outputs to be displayed when the simulation runs. There are two options available in the pull-down menu:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Standard Earthquake
\item USer Defined
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Standard Earthquake}
When the user selects standard Earthquake there are no additional inputs required. The standard earthquake EDP generator will ensure the the max absolute value of the following are obtained: \begin{enumerate}
\item Relative Floor displacements:
\item Absolute Floor Accelerations
\item Interstory Drifts
\end{enumerate}

The  results will contain results for these in abbreviated form:
\begin{itemize}
\item PFD peak relative floor displacement $1-PFD-FLOOR_CLINE$
\item PFA peak floor acceleration (relative + ground motion): $1-PFA-FLOOR-CLINE$
\item PID peak inter-story drift: $1-PID-STORY-CLINE$
\end{itemize}

\subsection{User Defined}
This panel allows the user to provde to determine their own output and process it. When using this option the user provides additional data:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Additional Input: These are additional commands that are invoked by the analysis application before the transient analysis is performed. For example, foe OpenSees this would be a script containing a series of recorder commands.
\item Postprocess Script: This is a python script that will be invoked after the finite element application has run. It must be provided by the user. It's purpose is to process the output files and create a single file, results.out. This file must contain a single line with as many entries as EDP's specified.

\item Response Parameters. This is an area in which the user associates a variable name with the column of the results output file. If the process script has an array of strings named named EDP's the script, the Response Parameters will be initially set with these values from the script.
\end{enumerate}


\section{RES}

When the user hits the Run button, and assuming the results are successful. The results are presented here.  A successful run or download of a job that ran successfully will result in 3 tabbed widgets being displayed in this panel.  The first panel shows summary statistics: mean and stdDev values or min-max values if discrete set, i.e. multiple events for each of the EDP's specified in the EDP panel.

\begin{figure}[!htbp]
  \centering {
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]
    {figs/Figure12.png} }
  \caption{RES}
  \label{fig:figure12}
\end{figure}

The second panel shows the summary information.

\begin{figure}[!htbp]
  \centering {
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]
    {figs/Figure13.png} }
  \caption{RES General tab}
  \label{fig:figure13}
\end{figure}

The third panel presents graphically and in tabular form the results. By selecting different columns with left and right mouse buttons in the table below the graphic, 
the information in the graph is changed. Selecting the left mouse button changes the Y axis, the right mouse changes the X axis. If the same column is selected 
using both left and right keys, the CDF and PDF is displayed. If last mouse press was with the left button, the PDF and if right the CDF.

As for the columns. You will see a column for each random variable the workflow came across. There may be more than you specified if the applications want the 
UQ engine to consider their own variables in the computation. The outputs at present are limited to:



\begin{figure}[!htbp]
  \centering {
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]
    {figs/Figure14.png} }
  \caption{UQ Data Values}
  \label{fig:figure14}
\end{figure}



\section{Push Buttons}
There are a number of buttons in the Push Button area of \autoref{fig:figure1}:
\subsection{RUN – to run the simulation of the user’s desktop machine.}
\begin{figure}[!htbp]
  \centering {
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]
    {figs/Figure15.png} }
  \caption{Run button}
  \label{fig:figure15}
\end{figure}
The window that pops up is as shown in \autoref{fig:figure15}. There are 2 entries and a push button: 

\begin{itemize}
\item Working Dir Location: specifies where the $EE_UQ$ application can create a “temporary” directory called tmp. SimCenter that the application 
creates when the submit button is pressed. The application creates this directory, copies files to it that the application needs as a result of your 
input (e.g. if you are using OpenSees input script, it will to the tmp. SimCenter directory copy that script, ALL FILES IN THAT DIRECTORY AND ALL FILES IN 
SUBDIRECTORIES OF THAT DIRECTORY GET COPIED SO DON’T PLACE THE SCRIPT IN HOME, DOWNLOADS, DOCUMENTS, ….
\item Application Dir Location: SHOULD NOT BE TOUCHED unless you are introducing your own applications or want to build and modify the 
applications provided with the tool. It is this directory the application tool looks to find the applications to run.
\end{itemize}


Finally, when inputs are finished the user hits submit button to start the backend job. If it runs the window will close and the RES 
panel will pop up on successful run. Do not press the submit button multiple times while waiting for it to close. We cannot guarantee 
what will happen and we did not disable the button in this release.

\subsection{RUN at DesignSafe}
Click this button to process the information, and send to DesignSafe where the job will be run on a supercomputer and results stored in your DesignSafe jobs folder.

\begin{figure}[!htbp]
  \centering {
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]
    {figs/Figure16.png} }
  \caption{Remote button}
  \label{fig:figure16}
\end{figure}

A similar bit longer input panel is brought up:
\begin{itemize}
\item JobName: The name the user can use to identify the job in Get from DesignSafe.
\item NumNodes: The number of compute nodes to use on Stampede2. Using the default App Name the job will run on Stampede2’s KNL Landing (KNL) 
compute nodes. Each node has 68 cores. The actual number of cores the application will use on each of these nodes depends on the total number of 
processes specified. As per the TACC webpage, for MPI tasks it’s best not to specify more than 64-68 processes to run. Depending on the numerical 
computations and amount of memory each uses, so as to avoid page faulting, for large simulations you may wish to use more nodes and less processes.
\item Total Number of Processes: Total number of MPI parallel processes the UQ engine is going to use.
\item Max Wall Time:  HOURS:MIN:SEC be conservative. Your job is killed after the time limit. On Stampede2 you have a max wall time of 24 hours.
\item App Name:   Name of Agave app to run. DO not touch unless you know what you are doing.
\item Working Dir Location: specifies where the $EE_UQ$ application can create a “temporary” directory called tmp. SimCenter that the application 
creates when the submit button is pressed. The application creates this directory, copies files to it that the application needs as a result of your 
input (e.g. if you are using OpenSees input script, it will to the tmp. SimCenter directory copy that script, ALL FILES IN THAT DIRECTORY AND ALL FILES 
IN SUBDIRECTORIES OF THAT DIRECTORY. (SO, DON’T PLACE THE SCRIPT IN HOME, DOWNLOADS, DOCUMENTS, …). That directory is removed when jib has been successfully submitted.
\item Local App Dir Location: SHOULD NOT BE TOUCHED unless you are introducing your own applications or want to build and modify the applications 
provided with the tool. It is this directory the application tool looks to find the applications it needs.
\item Remote App Dir Location: Remote directory on Stampede2 where applications needed by workflow reside. DO not touch unless you know what you are doing.

\end{itemize}


\subsection{GET from DesignSafe}
	Click this button to obtain from DesignSafe your list of jobs and select from that list a job to update status of, download or delete.

\subsection{Exit}
Click this button to exit the application.
