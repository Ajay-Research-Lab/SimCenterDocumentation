%% Chapter: Introduction


BASICALLY: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item
   Build your model
   
\item
   put your model in a box, define boundary patches in the .... file, use good/unique names.
   
\item
    define ....
    
\item 
    Ready for using this tool.
    
\end{enumerate}

The following Chapter~\ref{sec:TInF-installation} explains the installation of the tool and how to update your local OpenFOAM copy to implement the supported turbulent inflow models.
Chapter~\ref{sec:TInF-usage} will walk you through the steps required to add a turbulent inflow condition to your model.
Chapter~\ref{sec:TInF-theory} provides a detailed theoretical background on the provided turbulence models.
