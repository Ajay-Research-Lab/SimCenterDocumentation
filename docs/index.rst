|full tool name|
=====================================================================

The intended audience for the |full tool name| (|short tool name|) are researchers and practitioners interested in predicting the seismic performance of buildings.

.. only:: PBE_app

   This is an open-source research application that can be used to predict the performance of a building subjected to earthquake events. The application is focused on quantifying building performance given the that the uncertainties in models, earthquake loads, and analysis. The computations are performed in a workflow application that will run on either the users local machine or on a high performance computer made available by |DesignSafe|. 

.. only:: EEUQ_app

   This is an open-source research application that can be used to predict the response of a building subjected to earthquake events. The application is focused on quantifying the uncertainties in the predicted response, given the that the uncertainties in models, earthquake loads, and analysis. The computations are performed in a workflow application that will run on either the users local machine or on a high performance computer made available by |DesignSafe|. 


.. only:: WEUQ_app

   This is an open-source research application that can be used to predict the response of a building subjected to wind loading events. The application is focused on quantifying the uncertainties in the predicted response, given the that the uncertainties in models, wind loads, and analysis. The computations are performed in a workflow application that will run on either the users local machine or on a high performance computer made available by |DesignSafe|. 


This document covers Version |tool version|  of the tool. Users are encouraged to comment on what additional features and capabilities
they would like to see in this application through the |messageBoard|.
