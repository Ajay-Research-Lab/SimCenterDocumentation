Reliability Analysis
=======================================

If the user is interested in the probability that a particular response measure will be exceeded, an alternate strategy is to perform a reliability analysis. To obtain reliability results using the Second-Order Reliability Method (SORM) for the truss problem the user would follow the same sequence of steps as previously. In the figure the user is specifying that they are interested in the probability that the displacement will exceed certain response levels.

After the user fills in the rest of the tabs as per the previous section, the user would then press the **RUN** button. The application (after spinning for a while with the wheel of death) will present the user with the results.
