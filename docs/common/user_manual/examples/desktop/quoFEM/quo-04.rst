Sensitivity Analysis
=======================================

In a global sensitivity analysis the user is wishing to understand what is the influence of the individual random variables on the quantities of interest. This is typically done before the user launches large scale forward uncertainty problems in order to limit the number of random variables used so as to limit the number of simulations performed.

After the user fills in the rest of the tabs as per the previous section, the user would then press the ''RUN'' button. The application (after spinning for a while with the wheel of death) will present the user with the results.
