The event panel presents the user with a drop-down menu with a list of
available event applications. Event applications are applications
that, given the building and user supplied data inputs, will generate
a list of events (i.e., typically time-dependent loads that represent natural disasters) for the building. The following options
are available in the drop-down menu:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Stochastic Wind Event (\Cref{subsec:stochastic_wind})
\item DEDM HRP (\Cref{subsec:dedm_hrp})
\item CFD Expert (\Cref{subsec:cdf_expert})
\item Multiple Existing(\Cref{subsec:multiple_existing})
\end{enumerate}
