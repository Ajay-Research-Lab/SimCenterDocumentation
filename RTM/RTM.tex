\chapter{Introduction}
\label{chap:about}

The RTM are tables linking requirements with project deliverables.  The requirements for the SimCenter have been obtained from a number of sources:
\begin{enumerate}
\item GC: From the vision documents referenced in the solicitation [2, 3, 5, 6] that outline the grand challenges for wind and earthquake hazards. These documents all present a list of research and educational advances needed that can contribute knowledge and innovation to prevent natural hazards from becoming societal disasters. The advances needed were identified through specially formed committees and workshops comprising researchers and practicing engineers. They identified both the grand challenges faced and also identified what was needed to address these challenges. The software needs identified in these reports that are applicable to research in natural hazards as permitted under the NSF NHERI program were identified. Those tasks that the NHERI SimCenter identified as pertaining to NHERI related research are considered here.
\item SP: From the senior personnel on the SimCenter project. The vision documents outline general needs without going into the specifics. The senior personnel on the project from these general needs identified specific requirements that could be provided that would provided a basis to allow research 
\item UF: SimCenter workshops, boot camps and direct user feedback. As the SImCenter develops and releases tools feedback from researchers using these tools is obtained at the tool training workshops, programmer boot-camps,  and through one-on-one discussion, email and online user feedback surveys. 
\end{enumerate}  

The software requirements are many. For ease of presentation they are broken into two groups:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Regional Scale - software to allow researchers and to examine the resilience of a community to natural hazard events.
\item Building Scale - software to allow researchers to improve on methods related to response assessment and performance based design of individual buildings subject to effect of a natural hazard.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Building Scale}

For the building scale simulations, the requirements are broken down by SimCenter application. There are a number of applications under development for each of the hazards. Many of the requirements related to UQ and analysis options are repeated amongst the different applications under the assumption that if it is beneficial to engineers dealing with one hazard, they will be beneficial to engineers dealing with other hazards.

\subsection{Response of Building to Wind Hazard}
The following are the requirements for response of single structure to wind.. The requirements are being met by the WE-UQ application. All items are related to work in WBS 1.3.7.

 \input{requirements/WEUQ_Requirements.tex}

\subsection{Response of Building to Earthquake Hazard}
The following are the requirements for response of single structure to earthquake hazards. The requirements are being met by the EE-UQ application. All items are related to WBS 1.3.8.

 \input{requirements/EEUQ_Requirements.tex}


\subsection{Performance Based Engineering}
The following are the requirements for response of single structure to earthquake hazards. The requirements are being met by the EE-UQ application.
